## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema:

#### Student Model:
```javascript
{
  fullName: String,
  email: String (unique),
  matric: String (unique),
  phone: String,
  whatsapp: String,
  department: String (optional),
  password: String (hashed),
  role: 'student',
  savedHostels: [ObjectId], // References to Hostel
  applications: [{
    hostelId: ObjectId,
    appliedAt: Date,
    status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected'
  }],
  lastLogin: Date,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Gate Filtering Logic:
```javascript
// In hostels.html
function showHostelsByGate(gate) {
    const gateKeyword = gate.split(' ')[0].toLowerCase(); // "north", "south", "west"
    const filteredHostels = allHostels.filter(h => 
        h.location && h.location.toLowerCase().includes(gateKeyword)
    );
    displayHostels(filteredHostels);
}
```

### Hostel Location Format:
For proper gate filtering, realtors should include gate name in location:
- ✅ Good: "Behind North Gate, Akure"
- ✅ Good: "Near South Gate, FUTA"
- ✅ Good: "West Gate Area"
- ❌ Bad: "Akure" (no gate mentioned)
