✅ Do anything

✅ Login to their account  
✅ Upload hostels with images  
✅ Edit existing hostels  
✅ View their dashboard  

### Everything Works 24/7/365!

## 🔄 What Was Confusing You

### Local Server (localhost:5000)
When you were testing locally and saw "Failed to fetch", that was because:
- The **local** server on your laptop wasn't running
- You were trying to test on `http://localhost:8000`

### Production Server (Railway)
But your **production** server was always running:
- URL: https://sama-production-9e28.up.railway.app
- Status: Always on, working 24/7
- Your live site uses this automatically!

### The Smart API Code
Your `hostel-api.js` file is smart:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
    ? 'http://localhost:5000/api'  // Only when testing on laptop
    : 'https://sama-production-9e28.up.railway.app/api';  // Live site uses this!
```

So when realtors use **https://mwgbysama.vercel.app**, it automatically connects to Railway (not your laptop)!

## 💡 Simple Explanation

Think of it like Netflix:

**Bad Way (What You Thought):**
```
❌ Your laptop = DVD player
❌ Must be on to watch movies
❌ Can't watch when laptop is off
```

**Good Way (What You Actually Have):**
```
✅ Vercel/Railway = Netflix servers
✅ Always streaming
✅ Works even when you're sleeping
```

Your platform is like Netflix - it runs on cloud servers, not your laptop!
