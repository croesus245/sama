# 🧹 DASHBOARD CLEANUP - Remove Unnecessary Files

## Issues Found in Console

### 1. ❌ **404 Error: theme-toggle.js**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
Refused to execute script from 'https://mwgbysama.vercel.app/theme-toggle.js'
because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable
```

**Problem:** Dashboard tries to load `theme-toggle.js` but file doesn't exist  
**Impact:** Console error on every page load  
**Fix:** Removed script tag

### 2. 🔓 **Security Issue: Fixed Password System**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔐 MWG HOSTELS - Fixed Password System Loaded
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Password for all realtors: MWG@2025
Currently logged in: Abdul Sobur
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Problem:** `realtor-fixed-password-system.js` exposes password in console  
**Impact:** **CRITICAL SECURITY RISK** - Anyone can see password in dev tools  
**Fix:** Removed script tag

---

## Changes Made ✅

### Before:
```html
<!-- Theme System -->
<script src="theme-toggle.js"></script>

<!-- Load Fixed Password System -->
<script src="realtor-fixed-password-system.js"></script>
<script>
    // Lots of commented code...
</script>
```

### After:
```html
<!-- Theme toggle.js removed - file doesn't exist (404 error) -->

<!-- Fixed Password System removed - security risk (exposes password in console) -->
<!-- Dashboard initialization handled by initializeDashboard() function above -->
```

---

## Dashboard Still Works! ✅

The dashboard initialization is handled properly by `initializeDashboard()` which is called on line ~1550:

```javascript
// Initialize when page loads
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initializeDashboard);
```

**Console shows successful initialization:**
```
🏢 [DASHBOARD 8:26:01 AM] Dashboard page loaded
🏢 [DASHBOARD 8:26:01 AM] checkAuthentication() called
🏢 [DASHBOARD 8:26:01 AM] ✅ Authentication successful!
🏢 [DASHBOARD 8:26:01 AM] Step 1: Checking authentication...
🏢 [DASHBOARD 8:26:01 AM] Step 2: Authentication complete
