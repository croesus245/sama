## 📱 How Realtors Should Use It

### For Live Use (Without Your Laptop):

**Step 1**: Deploy your frontend to Vercel/Netlify (one-time setup)

**Step 2**: Realtors access your live URL:
```
https://mwgbysama.vercel.app/realtor-login-new.html
```

**Step 3**: They upload hostels - works 24/7! ✅

The system automatically uses the Railway production server (no laptop needed).

---

## 🔧 Current Configuration

Your `hostel-api.js` already has smart detection:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
    ? 'http://localhost:5000/api'  // Local (when testing on your laptop)
    : 'https://sama-production-9e28.up.railway.app/api';  // Production (24/7)
```

This means:
- ✅ When realtors use the **live website** → Uses Railway (24/7)
- ✅ When you test on **localhost** → Uses your laptop (only when on)

---

## 🎯 What You Should Do

### For Normal Operations (Realtors Using the Platform):

**You do NOT need to:**
- ❌ Keep your laptop on
- ❌ Run `node simple-server.js` on your laptop
- ❌ Do anything at all!

**Why?** Because Railway is already running your server 24/7!

### For Testing/Development (When Making Changes):

**You DO need to:**
1. Start local server: `cd backend; node simple-server.js`
2. Test on: `http://localhost:8000`
3. When done, stop the local server

---

## 🚀 Deploy Frontend to Make It Fully Live

Right now your backend is live, but if your frontend isn't deployed, realtors still can't access it online.

### Quick Frontend Deployment (5 minutes):

**Option A: Vercel (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
cd C:\Users\croes\Desktop\sama
vercel --prod
```

**Option B: Netlify**
```powershell
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy
cd C:\Users\croes\Desktop\sama
netlify deploy --prod
```

After deployment, realtors can access:
```
https://your-site.vercel.app/realtor-login-new.html
```

And upload hostels 24/7 without your laptop being on! 🎉
