Force Vercel Redeploy
=====================

This file forces Vercel to clear cache and redeploy all commits.

Time: 2025-10-21 - After duplicate variable fixes
Status: Triggering redeploy of commits ddea09d, b708cf2, 17a2191

The console errors show production is still serving old cached code:
- SyntaxError: Identifier 'notifications' has already been declared
- SyntaxError: Identifier 'style' has already been declared
- TypeError: this.loadHighQualityImages is not a function

These should all be fixed in commits already in GitHub.
This file triggers a new build/deploy cycle.
