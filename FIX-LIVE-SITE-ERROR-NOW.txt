📋 THE PROBLEM

When realtors try to upload hostels on:
https://mwgbysama.vercel.app/realtor-login.html

They see: ❌ "Error: Failed to fetch"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 MOST LIKELY CAUSES

1. ⚠️  Railway server is SLEEPING (free tier goes to sleep)
2. ⚠️  CORS (Cross-Origin) issue  
3. ⚠️  Old code deployed on Railway

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 QUICK FIX (Try This First!)

╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  STEP 1: Wake Up The Server                               ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Open this link in your browser:
https://sama-production-9e28.up.railway.app/api/health

⏳ Wait 30-60 seconds for it to load

✅ Should show: "MWG Hostels API is running"

╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  STEP 2: Test Hostel Upload Immediately                   ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Right after Step 1, quickly:

1. Go to: https://mwgbysama.vercel.app/realtor-login.html
2. Login as a realtor
3. Try uploading a hostel

✅ If it works now → Server was just sleeping!
❌ If still fails → Continue to Step 3

╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  STEP 3: Redeploy Railway Server                          ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Sign in with GitHub (croesus245)
3. Find your project (sama or mwg-hostels)
4. Click "Deployments" → "Deploy"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

Then test again!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧪 DIAGNOSTIC TOOL

I created a test page to help diagnose the exact issue:

📁 File Created: api-test.html

To use it:

1. Deploy it to Vercel:
   
   cd C:\Users\croes\Desktop\sama
   git add api-test.html
   git commit -m "Add diagnostic tool"
   git push

2. Open: https://mwgbysama.vercel.app/api-test.html

3. Click "Run Test" buttons

4. See exactly what's failing!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 PERMANENT FIX (Keep Server Awake)

If the problem is the server sleeping, use a free ping service:

Option 1: UptimeRobot (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://uptimerobot.com
2. Sign up (free)
3. Add monitor:
   - Type: HTTP(s)
   - URL: https://sama-production-9e28.up.railway.app/api/health
   - Interval: 5 minutes
4. Done! Server won't sleep anymore

Option 2: Cron-Job.org
1. Go to: https://cron-job.org
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create job:
   - URL: https://sama-production-9e28.up.railway.app/api/health
   - Every: 5 minutes
4. Done!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔍 HOW TO CHECK WHAT'S WRONG

Open Browser Console (F12) when you see the error:

Look for these messages:

"CORS policy blocked"
→ Fix: Redeploy Railway (Step 3 above)

"net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT"
→ Fix: Wake up server (Step 1 above)

"Failed to fetch"
→ Fix: Could be either - try both

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 TESTING CHECKLIST

Test these URLs to see what's working:

[ ] https://sama-production-9e28.up.railway.app/api/health
    Should show: "MWG Hostels API is running"

[ ] https://sama-production-9e28.up.railway.app/api/hostels
    Should show: List of hostels (JSON)

[ ] https://mwgbysama.vercel.app/realtor-login.html
    Should load: Login page

[ ] https://mwgbysama.vercel.app/api-test.html
    Should load: Diagnostic tool (after deploying)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 ACTION PLAN (Do In Order)

1. ☐ Wake up server (Step 1)
2. ☐ Test hostel upload immediately
3. ☐ If fails → Redeploy Railway (Step 3)
4. ☐ If still fails → Deploy diagnostic tool
5. ☐ Set up UptimeRobot for permanent fix
