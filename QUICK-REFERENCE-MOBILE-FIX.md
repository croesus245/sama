## 📋 DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST

If Step 2 tests fail, check these in order:

```
❓ Test 1: "Backend Server: Connection Failed"
  ➜ Restart service in Railway dashboard
  ➜ Wait 2-3 minutes
  ➜ Test again

❓ Test 2: "Database Connection: Failed"  
  ➜ Go to Railway dashboard
  ➜ Click "backend" service
  ➜ Check "Variables" tab has MONGODB_URI
  ➜ If missing, add it and redeploy

❓ Test 3: "Hostels Endpoint: Timeout"
  ➜ Check Railway logs for errors
  ➜ Verify MongoDB is running
  ➜ Restart backend service

❓ Test 4: "API Speed: Slow"
  ➜ This is normal on free Railway tier
  ➜ Upgrade to paid plan if needed
  ➜ Or optimize API code
```

## 🆘 EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

### If tests STILL failing after restart:

**Check 1: Is Railway account active?**
- Go to https://railway.app
- Verify you can login
- Check subscription status

**Check 2: Are environment variables set?**
- Railway Dashboard → backend service → Variables
- Should have: MONGODB_URI, NODE_ENV, JWT_SECRET, CLOUDINARY_*
- If missing: Add them manually

**Check 3: Is MongoDB running?**
- Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
- Find: "mwg-hostels" cluster
- Should show: Status = "Running"
- If stopped: Click "Resume"

**Check 4: GitHub push worked?**
- Check: https://railway.app/dashboard
- Click "Deployments" tab
- Should show: Latest commit deployed
- If nothing: Git push might have failed

---

## 🎯 WORST CASE SCENARIO

If nothing works after trying everything:

1. **Screenshot** the error message
2. **Take screenshot** of api-health-check.html results
3. **Note** the timestamp of when error occurred
4. **Save** browser console errors (F12 → Console)
5. **Send to** support@mwghostels.com with all screenshots

Include:
- Your mobile phone model
- Browser type (Chrome/Safari/Firefox)
- Network (WiFi/Cellular)
- Error message screenshot
- api-health-check.html results
- Time the error occurred

---

## 🚀 FINAL TIPS

1. **Always test from mobile** - Not just desktop
2. **Wait 3+ minutes** after deployment - Railway needs time
3. **Hard refresh** on mobile - Ctrl+Shift+R (Chrome) or Cmd+Shift+R (Safari)
4. **Try different network** - WiFi vs cellular
5. **Clear browser cache** - Settings → Clear data
6. **Try different browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
7. **Check time** - Error might be old, retry fresh

---

**Remember:** Most issues are fixed by just restarting the Railway backend!

If that doesn't work, follow the checklist above.

**You can do this! 💪**
