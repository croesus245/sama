# üñºÔ∏è Cloudinary Setup Guide for Direct Image Upload

## What is This?

This guide will help you set up **Cloudinary** (a free image hosting service) so realtors can upload hostel images directly from their computer instead of pasting URLs.

---

## üéØ Benefits of Direct Upload

‚úÖ **Easy for realtors** - Just click and select images from computer  
‚úÖ **Automatic optimization** - Images are compressed and resized automatically  
‚úÖ **Fast loading** - CDN delivery ensures images load quickly worldwide  
‚úÖ **10GB free storage** - More than enough for hundreds of hostels  
‚úÖ **Drag & drop** - Upload multiple images at once  

---

## üìã Step 1: Create Cloudinary Account (5 minutes)

### 1. Go to Cloudinary Website

Visit: **https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free**

### 2. Sign Up

Choose one of these options:
- **Email signup** (recommended)
- Google account
- GitHub account

### 3. Fill in Details

```
Full Name: Your Name
Email: your-email@example.com
Password: (create a strong password)
Company/Website: MWG Hostels (optional)
```

### 4. Verify Email

- Check your email inbox
- Click the verification link

### 5. Skip the Tutorial

- Click **"Skip"** or **"Dashboard"** to go to main page

---

## üîë Step 2: Get Your Credentials (2 minutes)

### 1. Go to Dashboard

After logging in, you'll see your **Dashboard**

### 2. Find Your Credentials

Look for a section called **"Account Details"** or **"Product Environment Credentials"**

You'll see three important values:

```
Cloud Name: xxxxxxxxxx
API Key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
API Secret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 3. Copy These Values

**IMPORTANT**: Keep these safe and don't share them publicly!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Create Upload Preset (3 minutes)

An upload preset allows frontend to upload images without exposing your API secret.

### 1. Go to Settings

- Click the **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** icon (top right)
- Click **"Upload"** in the left menu

### 2. Scroll to Upload Presets

- Scroll down to **"Upload presets"** section
- Click **"Add upload preset"**

### 3. Configure the Preset

```
Preset name: mwg_hostels_unsigned
Signing Mode: Unsigned ‚úÖ (IMPORTANT - must be unsigned!)
Folder: mwg-hostels/hostels
```

**Transformations** (optional but recommended):
- Max dimensions: 1920 x 1080
- Quality: Auto
- Format: Auto

### 4. Save

- Click **"Save"** at the top
- Note the preset name: `mwg_hostels_unsigned`

---

## üìù Step 4: Add Credentials to Your Backend

### Option A: Local Development (.env file)

1. Open `backend/.env` file
2. Replace the placeholder values:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_actual_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret
```

### Example (with real values):

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=mwg-hostels-prod
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890
```

### Option B: Railway Production (Environment Variables)

1. Go to **https://railway.app**
2. Open your **sama-production-9e28** project
3. Click **"Variables"** tab
4. Add these three variables:

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = your_actual_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = your_actual_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = your_actual_api_secret
```

5. Click **"Save"**
6. Railway will automatically restart your backend

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Test the Setup (2 minutes)

### 1. Restart Local Server

If you're testing locally:

```powershell
cd backend
node simple-server.js
```

### 2. Test Upload Endpoint

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/upload/config
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "cloudName": "your_actual_cloud_name",
    "uploadPreset": "mwg_hostels_unsigned"
  }
}
```

‚úÖ **If you see your actual cloud name** (not "your_cloudinary_name"), setup is complete!

---

## üé® Step 6: Update Frontend Upload UI

Now that Cloudinary is configured, we need to add the upload widget to the realtor dashboard.

### Files to Update:

1. **enhanced-realtor-dashboard.html**
   - Add Cloudinary upload widget script
   - Add upload button to "Add Hostel" form
   - Add upload button to "Edit Hostel" form
   - Add image preview

---

## üìä Cloudinary Dashboard Overview

### What You'll See:

- **Media Library**: All uploaded images
- **Usage**: Storage and bandwidth usage
- **Statistics**: Upload counts, views, transformations

### Free Plan Limits:

```
Storage: 10 GB
Bandwidth: 10 GB/month
Transformations: 25,000/month
Images: Unlimited uploads
```

**This is MORE than enough for your platform!**

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:

- Use unsigned upload presets for frontend
- Keep API Secret in backend only
- Use folder organization (mwg-hostels/hostels)
- Enable auto-moderation if needed

### ‚ùå DON'T:

- Never put API Secret in frontend code
- Don't share credentials publicly
- Don't commit .env file to GitHub

---

## üéØ What Happens After Setup?

Once configured, realtors will be able to:

1. **Click "Upload Image" button** in Add/Edit Hostel form
2. **Select image** from their computer
3. **See preview** before uploading
4. **Image uploads to Cloudinary** automatically
5. **URL is inserted** into the form field
6. **Image appears** in hostel listing

---

## üì± Testing Checklist

After setup, test these:

- [ ] Upload single image
- [ ] Upload multiple images
- [ ] Delete uploaded image
- [ ] View image in Media Library
- [ ] Check image URL works in browser
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Test large image (5MB+)
- [ ] Test wrong file format (should reject)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cloud name not found"

**Solution**: Check you copied the correct Cloud Name from dashboard

### Issue: "Upload preset not found"

**Solution**: 
1. Make sure preset name is `mwg_hostels_unsigned`
2. Verify it's set to **Unsigned** mode
3. Check spelling exactly

### Issue: "Invalid signature"

**Solution**: 
- This means API Secret is wrong
- Copy the exact value from dashboard
- Make sure no extra spaces

### Issue: "Folder not found"

**Solution**: 
- Cloudinary creates folders automatically
- No action needed - will work on first upload

### Issue: "File too large"

**Solution**: 
- Max file size is 5MB
- Tell realtors to compress images first
- Or increase limit in backend code
