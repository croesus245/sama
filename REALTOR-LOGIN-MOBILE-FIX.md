## 📋 How Login Flow Now Works

### Step 1: User Enters Credentials (Mobile)
```
User enters email & password on realtor-login.html
```

### Step 2: System Checks Storage Available
```
Try: localStorage.setItem(test)
If fails: Show "Private mode" error → Return
If success: Continue →
```

### Step 3: Submit to Backend
```
POST /api/realtor-auth/login
- Send: email, password
- Get: token, realtorData
```

### Step 4: Save to Storage
```
localStorage.setItem('realtorToken', token)
localStorage.setItem('realtorData', JSON.stringify(data))
sessionStorage.setItem('validLogin', 'true')
```

### Step 5: Mobile Sync Wait (3 seconds)
```
setTimeout(() => {
  // Verify data was saved
  if (token && data exist) {
    Redirect to dashboard ✅
  } else {
    Show error ❌
  }
}, 3000)
```

### Step 6: Dashboard Loads
```
enhanced-realtor-dashboard.html
- Checks localStorage for token
- Verifies with API
- Shows dashboard ✅
```
