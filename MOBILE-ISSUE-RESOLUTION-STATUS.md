# üéØ MWG HOSTELS PLATFORM - MOBILE ISSUE RESOLUTION STATUS

**Date:** October 25, 2024  
**Issue:** Mobile phone unable to access backend API - "server might be offline"  
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Requires Backend Deployment Verification  
**Resolution Time Estimate:** 10 minutes

---

## üìä SITUATION SUMMARY

### The Problem
User reports on mobile phone:
```
‚ùå "Unable to load hostel - server might be offline please try again"
```

### Root Cause Analysis
‚úÖ **Frontend Code:** All working correctly
‚úÖ **API Configuration:** Production URL properly set
‚úÖ **Database:** MongoDB Atlas configured and credentials present
‚úÖ **Authentication:** JWT tokens and password hashing in place
‚ùå **Backend Deployment:** Likely NOT deployed to Railway production yet

### Evidence
1. **api-config.js** correctly configured with production URL
2. **hostel-api.js** correctly detects production environment
3. **backend/.env** has all required credentials
4. **simple-server.js** has proper error handling and CORS
5. BUT: API endpoint `https://sama-production-9e28.up.railway.app/api/health` timing out
