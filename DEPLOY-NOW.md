## 🎬 DEPLOYMENT WALKTHROUGH

### STEP 1: Open Railway
```
1. Go to: https://railway.app

3. Choose "Login with GitHub"
4. Authorize Railway
```

### STEP 2: Create New Project
```
1. Click "New Project" button
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose repository: croesus245/sama
4. Railway starts scanning your repo
```

### STEP 3: Set Root Directory
```
Railway will ask: "Which directory contains your backend?"
- Type: backend
- Press Enter
```

### STEP 4: Add Environment Variables
```
Click the "Variables" tab, then add these 4 variables:

Variable 1:
Name: MONGODB_URI
Value: mongodb+srv://mwgadmin:%40Qwerty_12345@cluster0.n8satkn.mongodb.net/mwg-hostels?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

Variable 2:
Name: JWT_SECRET
Value: mwg-railway-production-secret-2024

Variable 3:
Name: NODE_ENV
Value: production

Variable 4:
Name: FRONTEND_URL
Value: https://mwgbysama.vercel.app
```

### STEP 5: Deploy!
```
1. Railway automatically starts building
2. Watch the deployment logs
3. Wait 2-3 minutes
4. See: ✅ "Deployed successfully"
```

### STEP 6: Get Your URL
```
1. Click "Settings" tab
2. Under "Domains", click "Generate Domain"
3. Railway gives you a URL like:
   https://mwg-hostels-backend-production.up.railway.app
4. COPY THIS URL!
```

---

## 🧪 TEST YOUR DEPLOYMENT

### Test 1: Health Check
Open in browser:
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/health
```

✅ Should show:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "MWG Hostels API is running",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### Test 2: API Info
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api
```

✅ Should show all endpoints and version 2.1.0

### Test 3: Hostels Endpoint
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/hostels
```

✅ Should return hostels array (might be empty)

---

## 🔄 UPDATE FRONTEND

After Railway deployment, update your frontend to use the new backend URL.

### Option 1: Quick Update (Hardcode URL)

Find these files and update:
- `api-connector.js`
- `api-integration.js`

Change:
```javascript
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api';
```

To:
```javascript
const API_URL = 'https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api';
```

### Option 2: Smart Update (Auto-detect)

```javascript
const API_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
    ? 'http://localhost:5000/api'  // Local development
    : 'https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api';  // Production
```

This way:
- Local development uses `localhost:5000`
- Production uses Railway URL
- No need to change code when testing locally

---

## 📱 AFTER UPDATING FRONTEND

1. Commit and push changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update API URL to Railway backend"
git push origin master
```

2. Vercel auto-deploys your frontend

3. Test everything at: https://mwgbysama.vercel.app

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Deployment Failed
- Check Railway logs (click "Logs" tab)
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Make sure root directory is "backend"

### Issue: Database Connection Failed
- Verify MONGODB_URI is correct
- Check MongoDB Atlas Network Access (allow all IPs)
- Password must be URL-encoded (@ = %40)

### Issue: CORS Errors
- Verify FRONTEND_URL matches your Vercel URL exactly
- No trailing slash in URL
- Make sure it's https:// not http://

### Issue: 502 Bad Gateway
- Check if backend crashed (view logs)
- Make sure PORT is set correctly (Railway auto-provides it)
- Restart the service
