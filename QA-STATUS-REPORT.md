## Bugs Identified & Fixed

### ✅ Bug #1: CRITICAL - Unable to Load Hostels
**Severity:** CRITICAL (Platform non-functional)  
**Root Cause:** `appOptimizer` not globally accessible  
**Fix:** Expose `window.appOptimizer = appOptimizer` in `app-optimizer.js`  
**Commit:** `ddea09d`  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED

**Impact Before:** Students cannot see any hostels  
**Impact After:** ✅ 2 hostels now display correctly

---

### ✅ Bug #2: HIGH - Missing Script Files (404 Errors)
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Root Cause:** 4 non-existent files referenced in `index.html`  
**Files:** `auth-system.js`, `realtor-verification.js`, `theme-toggle.js`, `realtor-registration-fixes.js`  
**Fix:** Removed all references from `index.html`  
**Commit:** `b708cf2`  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED

**Impact Before:** 4 × 404 errors, 4 × MIME type errors in console  
**Impact After:** ✅ All errors eliminated

---

### ✅ Bug #3: HIGH - Undefined Method Error
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Root Cause:** `enableHighQualityMode()` calls undefined `loadHighQualityImages()`  
**File:** `advanced-performance-monitor.js` line 448  
**Fix:** Simplified method to only run fallback code  
**Commit:** `b708cf2`  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED

**Impact Before:** TypeError crashes performance monitoring  
**Impact After:** ✅ Performance monitoring works correctly

---

## Remaining Issues (Not Critical)

### ⏳ Issue #1: Duplicate Variable Declarations
**Files:** 
- `form-enhancements.js` - Duplicate `notifications` variable
- `hostel-script.js` - Duplicate `style` variable

**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Console warnings, no functional issues  
**Status:** Identified, not yet fixed  
**Effort:** 15 minutes to fix

**Fix Strategy:**
1. Remove duplicate declarations from one file
2. Use conditional checks to prevent re-declaration
3. Test console has no warnings

---

### ⏳ Issue #2: Heroku Backend Timeout (503 Error)
**Reference:** `mwg-hostels-api.herokuapp.com` returning 503  

**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** None (correctly falls back to Railway backend)  
**Status:** Identified  
**Cause:** Old backend no longer active  
**Fix Strategy:** Remove reference to Heroku URL from codebase

---

### ⏳ Issue #3: Layout Shift Issues (CLS > 1.0)
**Metric:** Cumulative Layout Shift = 1.42 (target < 0.1)  

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Poor Core Web Vitals, user experience  
**Status:** Identified  
**Root Cause:** Dynamic content loading causes layout shifts  
**Fix Strategy:** 
1. Reserve space for dynamic content
2. Optimize image loading
3. Prevent reflow of hostel grid
4. Test with Lighthouse
