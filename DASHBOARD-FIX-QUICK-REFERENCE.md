# Dashboard Notifications Fix - Summary

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved

**Error:** `Failed to initialize dashboard. Error: notifications is not defined`

**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ Commit: `df3dcf8`

---

## üîç Root Cause

The `NotificationSystem` class is defined in `form-enhancements.js` and initializes a global `window.notifications` object. However, this script was **not being loaded** before the dashboard code tried to use it.

```
Dashboard tries to use notifications.show()
  ‚Üì
notifications object doesn't exist
  ‚Üì
Uncaught ReferenceError: notifications is not defined
  ‚Üì
Dashboard initialization fails
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution

**Added missing script import** to `enhanced-realtor-dashboard.html`

```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<script src="advanced-features.js"></script>
<script src="responsive-handler.js"></script>

<!-- AFTER -->
<script src="form-enhancements.js"></script>
<script src="advanced-features.js"></script>
<script src="responsive-handler.js"></script>
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This is a **production-critical fix**. The dashboard was completely broken on Vercel due to this missing script dependency. All users should now see the dashboard load successfully and receive proper feedback on their actions.
