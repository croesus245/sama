**Issue:** Realtor cannot login on mobile - page keeps bouncing back  
**Status:** 🟢 **FIXED & TESTED**  
**Commit:** 2d40807 (+ 2 supporting commits)

---

## 🐛 Root Causes Found

### Bug #1: Dashboard Logout Redirect (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `enhanced-realtor-dashboard.html` line ~996

**Problem:**
```javascript
// WRONG - File doesn't exist!
window.location.href = 'realtor-login-new.html';
```

**Fix:**
```javascript
// CORRECT - Actual login file
window.location.href = 'realtor-login.html';
sessionStorage.removeItem('validLogin');
```

**Impact:** After logout, users couldn't get back to login page properly

---

### Bug #2: Private Mode Not Detected (MOBILE-SPECIFIC)
**Location:** `realtor-login.html` DOMContentLoaded

**Problem:**
- Mobile users in Private/Incognito mode couldn't use localStorage
- No clear error - just showed empty login page
- Users didn't know what to do

**Fix Added:**
```javascript
try {
    const testKey = '__localStorage_test__';
    localStorage.setItem(testKey, 'test');
    localStorage.removeItem(testKey);
} catch (e) {
    showAlert('❌ Private/Incognito Mode Detected\n\n' +
             'This app needs cookies enabled...', 'error');
    return;
}
```

**Impact:** Users now get clear guidance on what to fix

## 📱 How It Works Now

```
1. Mobile user enters email/password
   ↓
2. System checks: Can we use localStorage?
   - YES → Continue
   - NO → Show "Private mode" error → Return
   ↓
3. Send credentials to backend API
   ↓
4. Get token back from server
   ↓
5. Save to localStorage + sessionStorage
   ↓
6. WAIT 3 seconds (mobile sync delay)
   ↓
7. Verify data was saved successfully
   ↓
8. Redirect to dashboard
   ↓
9. Dashboard loads ✅
```
