# üöÇ Railway Deployment Guide - MWG Hostels Backend

## üìã Overview
This guide will help you deploy your MWG Hostels backend to Railway.app, a modern deployment platform with free tier and automatic deployments.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before deploying, make sure you have:
- [x] GitHub account (croesus245/sama repository)
- [x] Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- [x] MongoDB Atlas database (already set up)
- [x] Backend code pushed to GitHub

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Sign Up / Login to Railway

1. Go to **https://railway.app**
2. Click **"Login"** or **"Start a New Project"**
3. Sign in with your **GitHub account** (croesus245)
4. Authorize Railway to access your repositories

---

### Step 2: Create New Project

1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose your repository: **croesus245/sama**
4. Railway will detect your backend automatically

---

### Step 3: Configure Deployment

1. Railway will ask about the root directory
2. Set root directory to: **`backend`**
3. Railway will auto-detect Node.js and use `nixpacks.toml`

---

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

Click on your deployed service ‚Üí **"Variables"** tab ‚Üí Add these:

```bash
# Required Environment Variables

# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://mwgadmin:%40Qwerty_12345@cluster0.n8satkn.mongodb.net/mwg-hostels?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

# JWT Secret (IMPORTANT: Change this!)
JWT_SECRET=mwg-railway-production-secret-key-2024-change-this

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Port (Railway provides this automatically, but you can set it)
PORT=5000

# Frontend URL (Your Vercel URL)
FRONTEND_URL=https://mwgbysama.vercel.app
```

**Important Notes:**
- ‚úÖ Railway auto-assigns a port via `$PORT` environment variable
- ‚úÖ Your backend code already uses `process.env.PORT || 5000`
- ‚úÖ Don't hardcode the port in Railway

---

### Step 5: Deploy

1. Railway will automatically start building
2. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. You'll see: ‚úÖ **"Deployed successfully"**

---

### Step 6: Get Your Backend URL

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on **"Settings"** tab
3. Under **"Domains"**, click **"Generate Domain"**
4. Railway will give you a URL like:
   ```
   https://mwg-hostels-backend-production.up.railway.app
   ```
5. **Copy this URL** - you'll need it for frontend!

---

## üîß Configure Frontend to Use Railway Backend

After deployment, update your frontend API configuration:

### Option A: Update API connector files

1. Find all API files in your frontend:
   - `api-connector.js`
   - `api-integration.js`
   - Any file with `localhost:5000`

2. Replace all instances of:
   ```javascript
   // OLD (Local)
   const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api';
   
   // NEW (Railway - Use your actual URL)
   const API_URL = 'https://mwg-hostels-backend-production.up.railway.app/api';
   ```

### Option B: Use environment detection

Update your API config to detect environment:

```javascript
const API_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
    ? 'http://localhost:5000/api'  // Local development
    : 'https://mwg-hostels-backend-production.up.railway.app/api';  // Production
```

---

## üß™ Test Your Deployment

### 1. Test Health Endpoint

Open in browser:
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "MWG Hostels API is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-11T12:00:00.000Z",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### 2. Test API Info

```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api
```

Should show all available endpoints.

### 3. Test Hostels Endpoint

```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/hostels
```

Should return list of hostels (might be empty if none added yet).

## üîÑ Automatic Deployments

Railway automatically redeploys when you push to GitHub:

1. Make changes to your backend code
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update backend"
   git push origin master
   ```
3. Railway detects the push and redeploys automatically
4. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status

---

## üìä Monitor Your Deployment

### Railway Dashboard Features:

1. **Logs**: View real-time server logs
2. **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Network usage
3. **Deployments**: History of all deployments
4. **Variables**: Manage environment variables
5. **Settings**: Configure custom domains

### View Logs:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. See real-time console output

---

## üåê Custom Domain (Optional)

### Add Your Own Domain:

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Domains"**
3. Click **"Custom Domain"**
4. Enter your domain: `api.mwghostels.com`
5. Add DNS records (Railway will show you what to add):
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: api
   Value: your-project.up.railway.app
   ```
6. Wait for DNS propagation (5-60 minutes)

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Change JWT Secret
Replace the JWT_SECRET in Railway variables with a strong random string:
```bash
# Generate a strong secret (run in terminal):
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

### 2. Enable CORS Properly
Make sure your backend only allows requests from your Vercel domain:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
  credentials: true
}));
```

### 3. Use HTTPS Only
Railway provides automatic HTTPS - always use it!

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Deployment Failed

**Check Build Logs:**
1. Railway dashboard ‚Üí Logs
2. Look for error messages
3. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Wrong start command
   - Node version mismatch

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure package.json has correct start script
"scripts": {
  "start": "node simple-server.js"
}
```

---

### Issue 2: Database Connection Failed

**Error:** "MongoDB connection error"

**Check:**
1. MONGODB_URI is correct in Railway variables
2. MongoDB Atlas allows Railway IPs (set to 0.0.0.0/0)
3. Password is URL-encoded (`@` becomes `%40`)

---

### Issue 3: 502 Bad Gateway

**Possible Causes:**
- Backend crashed
- Port not configured correctly
- Out of memory

**Solution:**
1. Check Railway logs for crash reasons
2. Ensure you're using `process.env.PORT`
3. Restart the service

---

### Issue 4: CORS Errors

**Error:** "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"

**Solution:**
Make sure FRONTEND_URL in Railway variables matches your Vercel URL exactly:
```
FRONTEND_URL=https://mwgbysama.vercel.app
```

(No trailing slash!)
