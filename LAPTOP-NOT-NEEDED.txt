━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 NEXT STEP: Deploy Your Frontend

Right now:
✅ Backend (Railway): LIVE
✅ Database (MongoDB): LIVE
⚠️ Frontend (Website): Deploy it so realtors can access online

To deploy frontend (one-time, 5 minutes):

   1. Open PowerShell
   2. Run: cd C:\Users\croes\Desktop\sama
   3. Run: npm install -g vercel
   4. Run: vercel --prod
   5. Done! Get your live URL

After this, EVERYTHING runs without your laptop! 🎊

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧪 TEST YOUR PRODUCTION SERVER RIGHT NOW

Open your browser and go to:
https://sama-production-9e28.up.railway.app/api/health

You should see: "MWG Hostels API is running" ✅

This proves your server is online RIGHT NOW, even though
you're not running anything on your laptop!

💡 SIMPLE ANALOGY

Think of it like Gmail:

❌ You DON'T need your laptop on for people to send you emails
✅ Google's servers receive emails 24/7

Same with your hostel platform:

❌ You DON'T need your laptop on for realtors to upload hostels
✅ Railway's servers receive uploads 24/7

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💰 COST

Railway: FREE ($5/month credit included)
MongoDB: FREE (512MB included)
